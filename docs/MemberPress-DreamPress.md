# Setting up 'DreamPress'

1) https://panel.dreamhost.com/

WordPress > Managed WordPress > 'Manage' for your site > Domain tab > 'Import Existing Site'

LOOKS GOOD! :)

EXTRA CONFIG:

2) Adjust webhook target in WP-Admin > MemberPress > Developer > Webhooks

Seems to be done :O (fuck that was easy!)
